                Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

                </h4>

            set
            up a free account with Balaji car clinic. While you can browse some sections of our site without being a

            contact
            information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.
            <br>
            <h4>
                Use of Demographic and Profile Data
            </h4>
            We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal
            information
            to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information
            to
            resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect fees owed; measure consumer
            interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and
            updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity;
            enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. In our
            efforts to
            continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyze demographic and profile data
            about
            our users' activity on our website. We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
            server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad
            demographic information. We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may
            ask
            you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this
            data
            to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in
            and
            to display content according to your preferences.

                Cookies
            </h4>
            A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a Web browser so it can be later read
            back
            from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given
            user.

            <h4>
                Sharing of personal information
            </h4>
            We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates to help detect and
            prevent
            identity theft, fraud and other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to prevent
            abuse of our services; and to facilitate joint or co-branded services that you request where such services
            are
            provided by more than one corporate entity. Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a result
            of
            such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law
            or
            in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to court orders, or other
            legal
            process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement offices, third party rights owners, or
            others
            in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms or Privacy
            Policy;
            respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or
            protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public. Shree om motors and its
            affiliates will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we (or
            our
            assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a transaction occur that
            other
            business entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to
            your
            personal information.
